		I was trying to explain basic data structures and sorting/searching to my son who is an aspiring programmer and video game<br/>
	    game designer.  I thought it would be so much easier to explain if there was some kind of graphic display that showed what<br/>
		happened to the data as the algorithm was executing.  So I came up with this idea and I am quite happy with how it has turned<br/>
		out so far.<br/><br/>
		Currently, I have implemented three variations of bubble sort.  I directly instrument the algorithm code to highlight each<br/>
		line of code as it is executed and to update the variable values, array contents and comparison count as needed.  See my<br/>
		gist at <a class="white-text" href="https://gist.github.com/sdocy/3665f924cfa629b0622315c17d9624c0" target="_blank"> bubbleSort()</a> for an example of the instrumentation I have done.<br/><br/>
		My next big step is to figure out how to visualize recursive calls in an understandable manner.  I am thinking that cloning<br/>
		the program, array and variable texts views in separate, stacked windows might do the trick, at least for the small examples<br/>
		I will be using.<br/><br/>
		I would love feedback on the usability of this prototype as well as the content I have provided for the algorithm.  I plan to<br/>
		eventually include basic information in the beginning on the data structures themselves (arrays, linked lists, trees).
