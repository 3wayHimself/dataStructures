		I was trying to explain basic data structures and sorting/searching to my son who is an aspiring programmer and video<br/>
	    game designer.  I thought it would be much easier to explain if I had a graphic display that showed what happens to the<br/>
		data as the algorithm is executing.  So I came up with this idea and I am quite happy with how it has turned out so far.<br/><br/>
		Currently, I have implemented three variations of bubble sort.  I directly instrument the algorithm code to highlight each<br/>
		line of code as it is executed and to update the variable values, array contents and comparison count as needed.  See my<br/>
		gist at <a class="white-text" href="https://gist.github.com/sdocy/3665f924cfa629b0622315c17d9624c0" target="_blank"> bubbleSort()</a> for an example of the instrumentation I have done.<br/><br/>
		My next big step is to figure out how to visualize recursive calls in an understandable manner.  I am thinking that cloning<br/>
		the program, array and variable texts views in separate, stacked windows might do the trick, at least for the small examples<br/>
		I will be using.<br/><br/>
		I would love feedback on this prototype as well as the content I have provided for the algorithm.  I plan to eventually<br/>
		include basic information in the beginning on the data structures themselves (arrays, linked lists, trees) and more<br/>
		sorting, searching and misc. other algorithms.
